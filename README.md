# Var

Var is a simple progrming language that I am creating for fun

## How to use it

The Var compiler/interpreter is used in command line with this command:
```bash
Var <Directory>
```

## Prerequisites

In Var, you need two type of files for your program to run/compile corectly:
the setup file : in this file you will put anything that Var needs to work;
the sources files : in this files you will put all of the source code
